Python 'Smart' Alarm

Created by - d0nkeyk0ng787

Description - I wanted to create a program using a 
few different api's, aswell as play around with
some new modules. So this is what came of it.

Usage - You will need to create an api key for
wolframalpha, spotify and the news. This is
fairly simple and there are plenty of guides
on the internet. You will have to modify the
code if you wish to use it. I have marked all the
areas where that is ncessary.

Also note when using spotify you will need to run
the following commands in your terminal with your
own keys.

set SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=USEYOURCLICENCETID
set SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=USEYOURSECRET
set SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=USEYOURURI

I still have a few things that need adding or
fixing but for now I shall leave it to work
on other projects.

Thankyou.
